				<h2>Cognitive Modeling Methods</h2>

				<h3>Homework discussion</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Play tic-tac-toe, with friend or a machine. Follow a car somehow. Play PONG.
					Read the Wikipedia entries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic-tac-toe</a>,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_cruise_control">Adaptive cruise control</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>.</p>
					<li>Think how some animal, a robot or an AI would do these.
					<li>Can you think of a MacGyver hack to do any of these. I.e. with paperclips, rubberbands, duct tape and such.
					<li>Try to remember somehow what you came up with for the next lecture

				</ul>

				<h3>Computational modeling</h3>
				<ul>
					<p>Try to get a stupid heap of silicon to act like it's smart.</p>
					<p>While the heap is stupid, it is huge. CPU billions of transistors, GPU tens of billions, RAM in trillions, SDD has even more.</p>
					<p>Human brain has about 100 billion neurons and order of 100 trillion synapses.</p>
					<p>Computers catching up brains on hardware, but far behind in software.</p>
				</ul>

				<h3>Computers are incredibly stupid</h3>
				<ul>
				<p>Literally incredibly stupid. Very few people believe how stupid they really are. Even after told.</p>
				<p>See <a href="https://youtu.be/EKWGGDXe5MA?t=61">Feynman's filing cabinet analogue</a>. (Note: starts from a <b>student question</b>!)</p>
				<p>Any intelligence in a computer is by chance or from its programmers.</p>
				<p>This is actually great. Smart computers would be really annoying!</p>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Humans are too smart for humans</h3>
				<ul>
				<p>And definitely too smart for computers!</p>
				<p>Computers need every single bit defined exactly. And quite a lot of bits are needed for anything</p>
				<p>Bad for intelligence, but great for modeling! Makes it (a bit) harder to fool yourself.</p>
				<p>"The first principle is that you must not fool yourselfâ€”and you are the easiest person to fool." -<a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">Feynman again</a>.
				</ul>

				<h3>Pieces of cruise control</h3>

				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Homework</h3>
				<ul>
				<p>Figure out (or find out) the optimal stragegy of tic-tac-toe. Write this as instructions a pre-school child could understand.</p>
				<p>Make a list of "things" that a human driver uses in "cruise control" (start with the simple scenario, expand to e.g. curved roads and different vehicles until you run out of paper).</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for the first hands-on modeling exercise!</p>
